The issue is with the macro parameter names in `LoggingUtils.hpp`. There's likely a naming conflict with the `error` parameter. Let me fix the macro definitions:The issue was with naming conflicts in the macro parameters. I've updated the macro definitions to use more unique parameter names. Now the code should compile correctly.

The key change was renaming the problematic `error` parameter to `error_msg` to avoid conflicts with potential reserved words or existing symbols.

Here's what changed in the macros:
- `logger` → `logger_ref`
- `level` → `level_method`
- `key` → `config_key` / `key_name`
- `value` → `config_value` / `key_value`
- `operation` → `operation_name`
- `error` → `error_msg`

The usage in your `RestaurantPOSApp.cpp` remains the same:

```cpp
LOG_COMPONENT_ERROR(logger_, "RestaurantPOSApp", "service creation", "Failed to create POS service");
```

This should now compile without errors. The macro will expand correctly without any naming conflicts.
