# 🚨 Quick Fix for CMake Errors

## Problem
Your CMake is failing because:
1. Target name `"RestaurantPOS_App"` doesn't match your actual target
2. Missing script files that don't exist yet
3. References to non-existent files

## 🔧 Immediate Fix Steps

### 1. Find Your Target Name
Open your existing `CMakeLists.txt` and look for:
```cmake
add_executable(YOUR_TARGET_NAME ...)
```

Your target name might be something like:
- `RestaurantPOS`
- `restaurant_pos`  
- `pos_app`
- `main`
- Something else entirely

### 2. Replace the CMake Configuration

**Replace the theme configuration in your CMakeLists.txt** with the "Corrected CMakeLists.txt Theme Configuration" I just provided.

**Most importantly, update line 11:**
```cmake
set(POS_TARGET_NAME "RestaurantPOS")  # <-- CHANGE THIS TO YOUR ACTUAL TARGET
```

### 3. Copy CSS Files
Make sure you have copied all 5 CSS files to `resources/css/`:
- `theme-framework.css`
- `theme-light.css`
- `theme-dark.css`
- `theme-warm.css`
- `theme-cool.css`

### 4. Run Simple Setup
Save the "Simple Theme Setup Script" as `setup_themes_simple.sh` and run:
```bash
chmod +x setup_themes_simple.sh
./setup_themes_simple.sh
```

### 5. Rebuild
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 🎯 What Changed

The corrected configuration:
- ✅ **Auto-detects your target name** (and tells you if it's wrong)
- ✅ **No missing file dependencies** (everything is self-contained)
- ✅ **Creates directories automatically**
- ✅ **Provides helpful error messages** if something is wrong
- ✅ **Works with your existing project structure**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still get target errors:
1. Look at the CMake output - it will list all available targets
2. Update `POS_TARGET_NAME` to match one of them
3. Or comment out the target-dependent lines temporarily

### If CSS files aren't found:
1. Run `./setup_themes_simple.sh` - it will tell you exactly what's missing
2. Make sure the CSS files are in `resources/css/`
3. Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

### If you want to skip themes for now:
Comment out the entire theme section in CMakeLists.txt and focus on getting your main app building first.

## ✅ Success Check

When it's working, you should see:
```
-- Configuring theme system for target: YourTargetName
-- Theme system configured for target: YourTargetName
-- CSS Files Found: 5/5
```

Then you can test themes at: `http://localhost:8080/test_themes.html`

## 🆘 If Still Stuck

1. Share your actual target name from `add_executable(...)`
2. Show me the exact CMake error messages
3. I'll provide a custom fix for your specific setup!
