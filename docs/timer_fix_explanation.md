# Fix for Table Selection Reset Issue

## Problem
The table selection in the OrderEntryPanel was resetting every 5 seconds because the periodic timer was causing the entire POSModeContainer to recreate its UI components.

## Solution: Two-Tier Refresh System

Instead of changing the timer interval (which would hurt user experience), we implemented a **smart refresh system** that distinguishes between:

1. **Data-only refreshes** (periodic timer) - Update data without recreating UI
2. **Full refreshes** (user actions) - Recreate UI when mode actually changes

## Key Insight

There are different types of updates that need different handling:

- **User Actions** (add item to cart, create order) → Need immediate UI feedback → Full refresh
- **Periodic Updates** (every 5 seconds) → Update data only → Preserve UI state  
- **Mode Changes** (switching between order entry/editing) → Need UI recreation → Full refresh

## Implementation

### 1. Added UI Mode Tracking
```cpp
enum UIMode {
    UI_MODE_NONE,
    UI_MODE_ORDER_ENTRY,  // Showing order entry interface
    UI_MODE_ORDER_EDIT    // Showing order editing interface
};
```

### 2. Two Refresh Methods

#### `refresh()` - Full refresh for user actions
- Checks if UI mode needs to change
- Recreates components only when switching modes
- Preserves UI when mode is the same

#### `refreshDataOnly()` - Safe periodic updates  
- **Never recreates UI components**
- Updates data in existing components
- Preserves all user input (table selection, etc.)
- Updates order counts, status displays, etc.

### 3. Smart Timer Usage

```cpp
// RestaurantPOSApp.cpp
void RestaurantPOSApp::onPeriodicUpdate() {
    // Use data-only refresh for timer updates
    posModeContainer_->refreshDataOnly(); // Preserves user input
}

// Event handlers use full refresh when needed
void POSModeContainer::handleCurrentOrderChanged() {
    currentUIMode_ = UI_MODE_NONE; // Force UI recreation
    updateWorkArea(); // Full refresh for mode change
}
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Responsive User Experience
- **5-second timer** kept for responsive data updates
- **Immediate feedback** when adding items to orders
- **Real-time updates** for order totals, kitchen status

### ✅ Preserved User Input  
- **Table selection preserved** during periodic updates
- **No UI flickering** during routine refreshes
- **Smooth interactions** without interruptions

### ✅ Efficient Updates
- **Minimal recreation** - only when mode actually changes
- **Event-driven** - UI changes when state changes
- **Data refresh** - numbers update without rebuilding UI

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: User Adding Items to Order
1. User clicks "Add to Order" → Event fired
2. `currentOrderDisplay_->refresh()` called immediately
3. Order total updates instantly ✅
4. Timer refresh (5s later) only updates data, doesn't recreate UI ✅

### Scenario 2: User Selecting Table  
1. User selects table from dropdown
2. Timer fires (5 seconds later)
3. `refreshDataOnly()` called → preserves table selection ✅
4. Only order counts and status data updated ✅

### Scenario 3: Creating New Order
1. User clicks "Start New Order" → Event fired  
2. `currentUIMode_` reset to force UI change
3. `updateWorkArea()` switches from entry to editing mode ✅
4. Full UI recreation with MenuDisplay and CurrentOrderDisplay ✅

## Result

Perfect balance of **responsiveness** and **user input preservation**:
- 5-second updates for live data
- Preserved form inputs during updates  
- Immediate feedback for user actions
- No annoying UI interruptions
